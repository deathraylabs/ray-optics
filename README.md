# Ray Optics Simulation

This is a fork of the insanely awesome Ray Optics Simulation created by Rick Tu. I wanted to learn some javascript and how this code was written, so this fork isn't really intended for anyone but me. It's best to assume that I've somehow destroyed the underlying code and that it's nothing you should be touching with less than a 10 ft pole.

Simulate reflection and refraction of light.
## Features
- Simulate various light sources: ray, beam, and point source
- Simulate reflection in plane or arc mirror
- Simulate refraction in plane or arc interfaces, including both refracted and reflected rays
- Simulate ideal lens/mirror, which obeys lens/mirror equation
- View extensions of rays to see if they converge to a virtual image
- View real images, virtual images and virtual objects directly
- View images that can be observed from some given position
- Distance and angular measurement
